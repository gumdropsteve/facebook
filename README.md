# posttopage-facebook
This will post your input to your Facebook (must be admin) without use of Facebook API (or need of Page Verification). 

ISSUE(S):
  It is likely you will encounter a 'Will you allow facebook.com to send you notifications?' pop-up
    Only been doing this for a few days and have absolutely no idea how to get around it 
      Sending the 'Esc' key MIGHT work
      Other ideas include having a (x, y) coordinated click
